# A REST API built with Node, Express, and Docker

This is an example of setting up a REST API powered by a Node server. It's not too bad on the Node side, but deployment gets pretty confusing — especially if you're a frontend developer.

This repo is a counterpart to [an example of deploying the same REST API using serverless](https://github.com/jlengstorf/api-using-serverless), which — in my humble opinion — is much less challenging to understand, deploy, and scale.
